# React Recipe Page with Tailwind CSS

This is a responsive recipe page built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It dynamically displays recipes from a JSON file, including information such as ingredients, instructions, preparation time, nutrition, and an image for each recipe. Users can navigate through the recipes using a "Next Recipe" button, which smoothly scrolls to the top of the page.
